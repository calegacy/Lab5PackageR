# Lab5PackageR

Our package creates a function called compMeans() that has the input of x, y, and z. 

x: a Data frame with at least 2 columns of data

y: The first column you want to analyze

z: The second column you want to analyze

Our function then finds the difference between the mean of column "y" and the mean of column "z". 

Along with the function, our package creates an example data frame, called newDataSet. The newDataSet dataframe has three columns and 100 rows. The first column is 100 standard normal random variables, the second column is 100 gamma(1,2) random variables, and the third column is 100 chi-square(15) random variables.
